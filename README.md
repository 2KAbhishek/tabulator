## Inspiration

I was trying to center a table in the page, also wanted to play around with the `eval` method.

## What it does

tabulator is a calculator with limited functionality, completely buil inside a `<table>` element.

## Prerequisites

- You just need a browser and text editor.

## Getting tabulator

To get tabulator, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/tabulator
cd tabulator
```

## How it was built

tabulator was built using Vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS.

## Challenges faced

While building tabulator the main challenges were figuring out gradients and box-shadow, I was trying to match the look and feel of a real calculator.

## What I learned

While building tabulator I learned more about centering elements, gradients, shadows and the eval method.
